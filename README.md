## Description

This is the repository for the accompanying exercises 
to the [Data Minded Academy](https://www.dataminded.academy/) training 
for [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/).

## Getting started

You can simply click the button below to start the exercise environment within Gitpod.

[![Open in Gitpod](

)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/vlieven/airflow-course)

### Airflow UI

This environment will set up an Airflow instance for you to use during the exercise session.
The Airflow UI will load in a new browser window once the startup is complete.
You can log in to the UI using "airflow" both as username and password.

### Mounted folders

The Gitpod environment you receive will contain three folders:
1. exercises
2. solutions
3. mount

The folder named *mount* will contain three sub-folders: dags, logs and plugins.
These three folders will reflect the internal state of Airflow for these points,
and can be used to upload DAGs or plugins into Airflow, or download log files.
